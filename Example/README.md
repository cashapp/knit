# Example Project

An example Xcode project that uses Knit.

## Setup

1. Open the `KnitExample.xcodeproj` project

For normal apps, the project should use the pre-complied executable binaries that are 
included in the GitHub release zips (per release version).
(You are also free to download any of the released binary executables and place it in the Example directory to use it.)
